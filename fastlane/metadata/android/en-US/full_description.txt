<h1><b>Why WordPress?</b></h1> 

There are a lot of blogging services, website builders, and social networks out there. Why create your website with WordPress?

<b>WordPress powers over a third of the web</b>. It’s used by hobby blogs, businesses of all sizes, online stores, even the biggest news sites on the internet. Odds are that many of your favorite websites are running on WordPress. 

<b>With WordPress, you own your own content</b>.  Other social networks treat you as a commodity, and assume ownership of the content you post. But with WordPress anything you publish is yours, and you can take it with you wherever you’d like.

<b>WordPress is an open source website creator</b>, meaning anyone can see how it's made, and even contribute.  Other services and social networks are proprietary, closed systems; you can never be sure exactly how they work or what they are doing -- and they can disappear!  

Whether you need a website builder to create your website, or a simple blog maker, WordPress can help. It gives you beautiful designs, powerful features, and the freedom to build anything you want.

WordPress for Android supports self-hosted sites running WordPress 4.0 and later, and all sites at WordPress.com. Just like WordPress, WordPress for Android is open source.
